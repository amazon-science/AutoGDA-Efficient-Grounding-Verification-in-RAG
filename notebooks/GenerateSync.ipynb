The sticky substance allows the pitcher to grip the ball more securely, enabling them to generate increased spin and movement on their pitches. This makes the ball much more difficult for the hitter to track and make solid contact with, leading to more swings and misses and weak contact.

Additionally, research from the Migration Advisory Committee found that EU and non-EU immigration had no significant statistical impact on UK-born employment during either 1975-1994 or 1995-2010. This is likely due to the fact that the size of the labor supply shift is matched by the amount of new jobs created, meaning there is no displacement effect.
